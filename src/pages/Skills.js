            Learning new technical knowledge by reading documentation or
            article.
          </span>
          &nbsp;For this placement, I was assigned to a task that I don’t have
          previous experience with. Namely, logging all user’s actions in their
          web application, creating a user onboarding (a tour guide feature)
          that will help users to use the existing application with ease, and
          creating a simple web application using the ReactJS language. Those
          are a few of the tasks that were assigned to me. To be able to achieve
          those tasks, I decided to read some documentation and articles that
          will help me develop them. It did not end up easy as I thought it
          would be. I needed to watch some online video tutorials and asked for
          help from my superior but In the end, I decided to improve my skills
          of learning from reading as this will be a good and important skill
          that is not only helpful for this placement but also for my future
          accomplishments. As discussed, the results for this skill did not give
          me the expected result there are some inaccuracies that I have
          experienced. Reading an old article will give a misleading solution to
          a problem that I’m trying to solve. Reading an old article for
          solutions will sometimes not work with the latest release as needed or
          it will misinform you on solving it in another way in which the new
          released there’s already a new way which is an easier and more
          proficient way to do it. Things I have learned while developing this
          skill is that always check for the release date of the article you are
          reading, this way you will know if the solutions you read are still
          appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve. Also, reading the
          official documentation of the technology you are trying to learn is
          always the best way to start than googling ways for your scenario
          problem. By doing that, it will give you more options on how you can
          solve your problem and from their documentation, you can come up with
          your own solution. Reading articles will also be helpful when you know
          the basic needs that you want which you will be able to get from the
          official documentation.

            Teamwork and learning their part of the task.
          </span>
          &nbsp;When we started the internship project, they assigned us
          different tasks to complete the whole project. I was assigned the
          front-end part, but this doesn’t mean that I will just work with my
          part regardless of other’s interns’ tasks. As much as possible I tried
          to align my work with others’ tasks. In that way, it will make it
          easier for everyone to complete our project goal. I tried to discuss
          with each intern their tasks that will affect the output of my own
          task. As a basic knowledge, the front-end will be responsible for
          displaying the results, looks and feel of the project in that sense,
          all the items that will be displayed on the front-end will be coming
          from different parts of the project. Knowing how the logic of the
          program works, I will be prepared to display everything on the
          front-end side. In my free time, I tried to read their codes to
          understand how they achieved their tasks. In that way, I would also
          learn all the parts that complete our project objectives. As a team, I
          think this skill is important whenever some issues come up. Making
          sure I contribute with some tasks that will make our project easier to
          develop will also help anyone to lessen the mistakes that can happen.
          Another incident that I think this kind of skill is effective was when
          one of our teammates got sick and we needed to do his part to move
          forward with our tasks, learning his tasks beforehand will help us
          solve the problem and we can all move forward in finishing our
          project. Teamwork is an important skill for an ICT profession as this
          will make our work more properly. Coming from someone who has
          experience working in ICT industry, this skill is important because
          working with a large company, you will most likely be assigned to a
          project working with a team and communication with your team will
          reduce faults that can cause delays in the project.

            Making and Understanding how the system works.

          &nbsp;Learning a programming language that I have never used before,
          code changes that will affect the whole system from working as
          expected. These are the two (2) few things that I have experienced
          from my placement. For me, learning a new language was never hard (as
          a subjective opinion) as much as you know the basics of coding,
          learning will be easier. As an ICT professional, I believe that
          memorizing a whole language will not help you with your career. It is
          how you understand how it works that will help you grow your career.
          Technology matures every day; new technologies are continuing to
          evolve as time passes. I have heard from some friends that applying
          for a job, specifically here in Australia, they will not ask how well
          you know a certain programming language. What they usually ask is how
          well can you learn technology each time that will contribute to their
          project or company. Also being mindful of our code changes is
          certainly one of the critical skills that we need in working in the
          industry. Making sure that your code changes won’t affect everyone is
          important in developing with a team. I realized this when one incident
          in our placement happened, we tried to figure out why the application
          is not working. I needed to check our repository for changes that were
          just committed before it happens then discovered that one single
          change (change of variable name) caused the problem. Being mindful
          about your changes and testing before applying the changes is always a
          good practice for this kind of job.
