            When I was applying for a placement, I got 2 offers, from Goldcoast
            health and SecureStack. Choosing between these two (2) offers gave
            me a dilemma. I did list the pros and cons of these two placements.
            The Pros and Cons of these placements are listed below:

              <div className="font-black col-span-2 border p-2">

              </div>
              <div className="font-bold border">Pros</div>
              <div className="font-bold border">Cons</div>
              <div className=" border">IT Environment</div>
              <div className="row-span-3 border">Start-up</div>
              <div className=" border">Start-up</div>
              <div className=" border">Working with a team</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            I want to clarify why being a start-up company are both pros and
            cons side, in my opinion, being a start-up company means that it is
            still not stable enough to cater for interns and will make our
            experience worthless. But on the other note, being a start-up
            company, from experience, I know that we can learn many things that
            will help us in the future.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To further help with deciding, I also did a little research about
            each company, it was evident that GoldCoast health is a big company
            that is stable enough to help intern students, but will this
            opportunity help me learn the knowledge that I can use in the
            future. SecureStack is a start-up company and was named one of the
            top 20 start-ups to watch. (https://securestack.com/forbes-list/).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Also searching about these companies’ objectives for the placement
            and services helped me decide on which path to take. For GoldCoast
            Health, I needed to produce a system for their attendance process
            that will help them monitor their staff. For SecureStack, I was
            supposed to make success metrics for their application. To be
            honest, at first, I didn’t know what that will be or if that will
            help me or not for my future endeavours so I googled the services
            they are offering and to my surprise, they are developing a service
            that will help software engineers with their work. This impressed me
            as I had this idea back when I was still working back in my country
            that what if someone develops an algorithm that will help software
            engineers to make fewer mistakes with their work even before
            deploying their system to production. And that idea never left my
            mind that it will help many software engineers like me in the
            future. With that, it made me choose SecureStack.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I also asked someone from the university if I can volunteer for
            GoldCoast Health while I’m doing my placement with SecureStack. But
            I got a no for an answer and said that If I do that it will give
            less opportunity for other students to take this placement. During
            the first two (2) weeks of the placement, I got offered a paid job
            that is related to my wanted career. During this time, it comes to
            my mind that I should have taken the GoldCoast Health placement
            instead of SecureStack by doing that I thought it will give me more
            control to manage my time for both placement and work. But as time
            passed, I told myself that I made the right decision to choose
            SecureStack for my placement as now I am learning many things that
            will help me in my future as an ICT professional. Working in an ICT
            environment here in Australia is also one of my key requirements in
            choosing which placement path to take is having an experience with
            that kind of environment will help me prepare for the future when I
            start working after I finish my degree. And I know that working in a
            start-up company will give me that experience and it did not
            disappoint.
